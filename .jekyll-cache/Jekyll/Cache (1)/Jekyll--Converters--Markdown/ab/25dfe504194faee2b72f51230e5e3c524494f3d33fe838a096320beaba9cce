I"­<p>La MaMa Galleria presents the NYC premiere of CROWDS, a 3-channel video installation by filmmaker and choreographer Sarah Friedland from November 7 - December 1, 2019 as part of the Performa 19 Biennial Consortium. Animating a durational dance of 22 dancers fluctuating between dozens of crowd types, CROWDS investigates the choreography of crowd typologies and the slippages between them.</p>

<p>Much like a flock of murmurating birds, the thresholds between these crowd types are blurred and distorted: the rocking of bodies in prayer transmute into the shaking of raving dancers, the training exercises of sports teams slide into the structured formations of fascist spectacles. CROWDS articulates the choreographic register embedded in our political discourses and polemics.</p>

<p>The dance evolves through choreographic shifts that signal the thresholds and transitions between one crowd type and another. Utilizing an archive of sensational to amateur YouTube videos in concert with the embodied memories of the dancers performing in this project, CROWDS reveals what is amassed and what is lost as we gather and disperse. Presented simultaneously and synchronously across three overlapping screens, each more intimate than the next, the three channels oscillate in their timing, emphasizing the distinct privileges and disadvantages of each viewing position. The viewerâ€™s body enacts the edit between channels - and points of view - by shifting their position within the installation space. No viewer can experience an all-encompassing view of the crowd.</p>

<p>CROWDS received its world premiere at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in March 2019. It was produced by Brighid Greene and Sarah Friedland, co-produced by Art Factory International, and generously supported by the Bologna Film Commission, a grant from the New York State Council of the Arts and Wave Farm, a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant, and 118 Kickstarter backers.</p>
