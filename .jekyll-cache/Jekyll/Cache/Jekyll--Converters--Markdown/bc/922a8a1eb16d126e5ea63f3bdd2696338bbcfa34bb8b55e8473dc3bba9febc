I"ò<p>Hartnett Gallery presents the digital premiere of CROWDS, a 3-channel video installation by filmmaker and choreographer Sarah Friedland from March 29 to April 26th, 2021. Animating a durational dance of 22 dancers fluctuating between dozens of crowd types, CROWDS investigates the choreography of crowd typologies and the slippages between them.</p>

<p>Much like a flock of murmurating birds, the thresholds between these crowd types are blurred and distorted: the rocking of bodies in prayer transmute into the shaking of raving dancers, the training exercises of sports teams slide into the structured formations of fascist spectacles. CROWDS articulates the choreographic register embedded in our political discourses and polemics.</p>

<p>The dance evolves through choreographic shifts that signal the thresholds and transitions between one crowd type and another. Utilizing an archive of sensational to amateur YouTube videos in concert with the embodied memories of the dancers performing in this project, CROWDS reveals what is amassed and what is lost as we gather and disperse. Presented simultaneously and synchronously across three overlapping screens, each more intimate than the next, the three channels oscillate in their timing, emphasizing the distinct privileges and disadvantages of each viewing position. The viewer enacts the edit between channels - and points of view - by moving between the three perspectives. No viewer can experience an all-encompassing view of the crowd.</p>

<p>To navigate through the installation, press the right  ‚Üí and left ‚Üê arrow keys, or the up ‚Üë and down ‚Üì arrow keys to move between the three points of view. Playback of all three channels begins immediately upon entry into the site and cannot be paused. If playback is interrupted due to connectivity issues or unstable internet, keep the site open and wait for playback to resume. If it doesn‚Äôt resume, refresh the page.</p>
