I"f<p>Can you talk more about your process of choreographing CROWDS? Part of what you seem to be doing in taking apart the gestures of crowds is asking questions about how a shift in gesture works to change the kind of crowd it is, say from a march to a protest to a riot. What are arms and legs doing? What’s their tone, their slackness? How are they connected to the rest of the body’s posture, to the speed of its locomotion?</p>

<p>In your choreography, you also seem to be thinking about if and how the gestures of crowds can be separated from a particular context and intention - and then stitched back together to evoke those historical moments. How do those gestures travel through time and across space - both through representation and in our very bodies? How do those gestures operate in other historical moments, or in the service of other ideologies?</p>
