I"ﬂ<p>The cliche of the ‚Äúface in the crowd,‚Äù enacted usually through a close-up shot with a long lens through which the other faces fade out of focus, visually claims that individual testimony. Yet from the perspective of the overhead shot you see both that the crowd‚Äôs a body composed of many bodies, and also the emergence of a unified body. Part of the desire for the bird‚Äôs eye view is its production of a headcount. From above, heads become individual data points.</p>
