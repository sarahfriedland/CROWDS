I"`<p>I was listening to an interview with some Hong Kong protesters who shared the motto they repeat to one another: “never sever ties.” It reflects the logic of murmuration, and flocking patterns in general: each must remain connected to the next and reproduce its movement; group coherence and flow is dependent upon individual movement. Which is manifest in the “flocking” exercise used in Viewpoints theater practice, which we used as a sort of container for our own improvisation within the studio in which we would articulate a set of rules or logics that the dancers would adhere to before slowly loosening, mutating, and breaking them. In thinking through the strategy or purpose of those protests, that motto, “never sever ties,” articulated the choreographic logic that would allow them to occupy public space and be present with one another. I love this description of politics in terms of a collective kinesthetic relationship. It reminds me of André Lapecki’s essay on choreopolicing in which he describes “imagining and enacting a politics of movement as a choreopolitics of freedom.”</p>
