I"Û<p>Sarah and I were at a conference and I learned that she was also a mover, as well as a filmmaker and a thinker. We were both thinking about murmuration, like the starling murmurations that you see on YouTube with birds flying in incredible patterns, but for different reasons. Sarah was thinking about the phenomenon of murmuration in relation to CROWDS when she was looking at lots of images online, and thinking about both the grammars of crowds and their representation as she got ready to head to Italy to work on the film. I recently learned that starlings murmurate in response to a predator, like a hawk or an eagle. That‚Äôs not something you usually look for in the frame, but very often a much larger bird is visible. Thinking about murmuration as a tactic in response to threat got me thinking about crowds of people, whether in a protest or in terms of how they were represented in data visualization, which I have been working on.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd been thinking about the movement of starling murmurations in relation to murmuring as a form of vocal protest for weak or vulnerable human subjects. The murmur is figured as more of a continuous vibration than a sound object. Even more so than Mladen Dolar‚Äôs examples of the prelinguistic voice (such as the child‚Äôs cry, the cough, the hiccup, and the scream), a murmur is indistinct, blurry, and continuous. Rather than a sharp, differentiated, identifiable sound, the murmur suggests temporal continuity and potential endlessness, coming in the form of a ‚Äúhum, humming, buzz, buzzing, thrum, thrumming, drone, sigh, rustle.‚Äù</p>

<p>Sarah was also thinking about starling murmuration, but specifically in relation to gesture and the physical movement of crowds.</p>
