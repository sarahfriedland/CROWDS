I"ø<p>Why is it important to consider both how crowds operate and how we read them? In part, itâ€™s important because we need to think about how we understand crowds and their politics - and recently, it feels like there are increased stakes to reading the choreography of crowds. For example, does a Bernie Sanders rally look different from a Trump rally from overhead? From the ground? What about crowds of protest? What about the strangeness of the right-wing protests on January 6th at the Capitol?</p>
