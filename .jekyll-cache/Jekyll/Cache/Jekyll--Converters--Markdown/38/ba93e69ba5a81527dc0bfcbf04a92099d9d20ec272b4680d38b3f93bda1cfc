I"Œ<p>Bakhtin describes the carnivalesque as set apart from the order of everyday life and turning that order upside down. Itâ€™s anti-elitist, a popular celebration of the bodily, the vulgar, the humorous, and the nonsensical. Carnival is seen as inherently bringing together opposites, like birth and death, high and low. Itâ€™s also seen as both revolutionary, and as staving off revolution.</p>
