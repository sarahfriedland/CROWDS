I"‹<p>That feeling of distance is part of how I conceptualized the 2nd channel, which is what I called on set our ‚Äúsideline‚Äù view. One of the main logics of crowds, Elias Canetti argues, is that once you enter, there‚Äôs an attraction towards one another to fill in and close all spaces between yourself and the other bodies. I kept seeing shots in my research that might be varied in framing style, but that all hovered right at the edge of the crowd, at the periphery between where you‚Äôre a spectator and a participant, on the verge of giving into that pull or attraction to being surrounded by the crowd that Canetti writes of, and the safety of distance. It‚Äôs an invisible threshold. But remaining in the space between is untenable. So the idea behind the second channel ‚Äì a tracking shot slowly wrapping around the circumference of the piazza ‚Äì is to place the viewer at the place where they have to make a choice between visual access and participation.</p>

<p>My intention for the installation design‚Äôs effect was that you‚Äôd experience the agency to move between perspectives, while also carrying the knowledge of loss. In moving in between the three channels you will not, and cannot, see everything. You can never access a totalizing view of the crowd. And so your body enacts the edit between shots, screens, and points of view, in such a way that you have to contend with the privileges and disadvantages of each perspective.</p>
