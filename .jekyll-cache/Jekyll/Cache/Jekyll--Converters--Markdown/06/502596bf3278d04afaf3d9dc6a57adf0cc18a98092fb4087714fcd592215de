I"ë<p>I was also thinking about CROWDS as a choreography that references the gestures of crowds, takes them out of context, and reorganizes them. At the same time, your choreography of gestures invokes the situations from which they emerged, whether itâ€™s a funeral procession or military procession, for example. Thereâ€™s both a clear structure to CROWDS, and an inherent instability because the gestures you incorporate are always in flux, moving from one thing to another so that the gesture doesnâ€™t always become recognizable through repetition. Since each gesture is always in the process of becoming something else, your morphing crowd doesnâ€™t always have a legible identity. Thatâ€™s a really interesting tension in the piece - the tension between structure and flow, clarity and illegibility. Additionally, it seems like the points of view through which you shoot your crowd of dancers, whether long shot or close up, really changes what becomes legible to a viewer at different moments.</p>
