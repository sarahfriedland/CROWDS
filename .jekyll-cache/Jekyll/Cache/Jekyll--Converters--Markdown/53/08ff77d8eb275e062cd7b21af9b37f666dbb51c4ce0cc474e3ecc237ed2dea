I"í<p>Exactly. And part of the efficacy of the fascist salute is that even from above, you see the clarity of that arm. So you get both the sense of a singular voice and its testimony in the unique performance of the gesture (how high is the arm? How straight the elbow? etcetera) and the compression to a dot, providing evidence of a unified mentality en masse. I think thereâ€™s something about the straight line of the arm, the directionality of the gesture, that fortifies the headcount.</p>
