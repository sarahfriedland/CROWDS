I"–<p>One of the sources of clarity and structure is the reproduction in CROWDS of repeated views from documentation of crowds: of the bird‚Äôs eye view, the face in the crowd, and what I had been calling on our shotlist the ‚Äúsideline‚Äù view. A big part of my research was tracking not only the choreography of crowds, but the cinematographic tropes and frames that are repeated in their documentation. I‚Äôm fascinated by the fact that representations of contemporary protests rely upon similar cinematography as fascist propaganda, particularly in their use of the overhead shot, also known as the bird‚Äôs eye or god‚Äôs eye view. That shot of the crowd, whose prototype we see in Leni Riefenstahl‚Äôs Triumph of the Will, is used for populist documentation on both the left and right.</p>

<p>During and after Bernie Sander‚Äôs 2019 rally in Queens, an overhead image of the large crowd was continually reposted with phrases such as ‚Äòwe‚Äôre gonna win.‚Äô The unspoken logic of this shot is that in its wideness you can see the sheer number of people present ‚Äì the masses ‚Äì who are visible from this perspective. At a glance, they evidence the will of the people. What‚Äôs interesting, though, is that this perspective is usually impossible for most individuals to access without a drone or helicopter. And this comes back to your work on the anxieties of loss in representations of magnitude: when you are in a crowd, you are aware of this overhead perspective that you don‚Äôt actually have access to in the moment. You know you are part of its magnitude. What is the significance of the shared appeal of this viewpoint for both fascist propaganda, big data, and left-wing populism?</p>
