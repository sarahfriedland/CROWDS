I"©<p>In my rehearsals with the dancers, it was also important for us to play with certain rhythms of speech and clapping, both in terms of how they influence the body, but also how they can shape the sense of time and rhythm within the crowd. For example, while we were rehearsing there were independence protests happening in Catalan in which there was this escalating clapping pattern that kept being reproduced in documentation. I shared this footage and clapping pattern with the dancers and the Italians in the room were immediately like, ‚ÄúNo, no, no. In Italy we do it like this.‚Äù And they shared with us the anti-war clapping pattern from protests they had been to, which rhythmically accompanies the words ‚ÄúNoi la guerra non la vogliamo,‚Äù meaning ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt want the war‚Äô. And then everyone started sharing different clapping patterns from protests that they had been in, which started fusing together. The clapping became a way of coming together around a certain rhythm, but it also offered the opportunity for escalation. This is indicative of how we worked, bringing in found movement and rhythms from protests we had been in or seen, that began to cross-pollinate.</p>
